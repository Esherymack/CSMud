# CSMud
CSMud is a MUD-style game based in .NET/C#, developed independently. Development is ongoing.

### Current Features
* Multi-player - players connect to launched server via telnet. 
* Chat - Connected players may chat with each other via whispers or based on rooms.
* XML-based map construction - Maps can be constructed via simple XML setups. New objects, entities, rooms, and doors are constructed similarly. 
* Combat - Players can fight enemies independently or as teams. 
* Bartering - Players can trade with friendly NPCs, as well as get news from them.

### Planned features
* Containers are to be added for further dimensionality (rather than spilling all loot out onto the floor)
* Keys are to be added for locked doors, and locked containers.
* Traps are to be added for puzzles and such.
* World timers are to be added to make the world feel more "alive" - enemies will automatically attack if not attacked first, and combat will progress regardless of player actions to feel less "turn based" and more "real time" than it really is.
* Dark rooms and light sources are to be added.
* Player persistence - Players will create usernames, passwords, and have character objects stored in a persistent database that will allow them to leave and rejoin games. 
* Quests and journals - NPCs will have the ability to offer quests to players. Players will be able to accept or decline these. Accepted quests will be logged in the player's journal.
* Crafting - Players will be able to craft items such as food, armor, and weapons.
* Magic - Players will be able to cast spells.
